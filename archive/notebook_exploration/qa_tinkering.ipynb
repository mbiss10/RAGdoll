We will cover a number of general topics such as: agency and initiative, AI and ethics, bias transparency, confidence and errors, human augmentation and amplification, trust and explainability, and mixed-initiative systems. We explore topics via readings and projects across the AI spectrum, including: dialog and speech-controlled systems, computer vision, data science, recommender systems, text summarization, and UI personalization, among others.', metadata={'source': './csci.pdf', 'filename': './csci.pdf', 'page_number': 15, 'category': 'NarrativeText'}),\n",
