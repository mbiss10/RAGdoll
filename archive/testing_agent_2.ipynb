It couples work on program design, analysis, and verification with an introduction to the study of data structures. Data structures capture common ways in which to store and manipulate data, and they are important in the construction of sophisticated computer programs. Students are introduced to some of the most important and frequently used data structures: lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs, and files. Students will be expected to write several programs, ranging from very short programs to more elaborate systems. Emphasis will be placed on the development of clear, modular programs that are easy to read, debug, verify, analyze, and modify.', metadata={'source_url': 'https://catalog.williams.edu/CSCI/detail/?strm=&cn=136&crsid=010803&req_year=0'}), Document(page_content='Computer Science thesis; this is part of a full-year thesis (493-494).', metadata={'source_url': 'https://catalog.williams.edu/CSCI/detail/?strm=&cn=494&crsid=010825&req_year=0'}), Document(page_content='This course introduces students to the science of computation by exploring the representation and manipulation of data and algorithms. We organize and transform information in order to solve problems using algorithms written in a modern object-oriented language.

We also begin the study of abstraction, self-reference, reuse, and performance analysis. While the choice of programming language and application area will vary in different offerings, the skills students develop will transfer equally well to more advanced study in many areas. In particular, this course is designed to provide the programming skills needed for further study in computer science and is expected to satisfy introductory programming requirements in other departments.', metadata={'source_url': 'https://catalog.williams.edu/CSCI/detail/?strm=&cn=134&crsid=010801&req_year=0'}), Document(page_content='This course investigates methods for designing efficient and reliable algorithms.

We will study several algorithm design strategies that build on data structures and programming techniques introduced in Computer Science 136.

Students are introduced to some of the most important and frequently used data structures: lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs, and files.

We also begin the study of abstraction, self-reference, reuse, and performance analysis.

      "Response: The CS major requirements at Williams College include a minimum of 8 courses in Computer Science, including 4 core courses: Computer Science 237 Computer Organization, Computer Science 256 Algorithm Design and Analysis, Computer Science 334 Principles of Programming Languages, and Computer Science 361 Theory of Computation. In addition, students must complete two introductory courses: Computer Science 134 Introduction to Computer Science and Computer Science 136 Data Structures and Advanced Programming. To be eligible for admission to the major, a student must have completed at least two Computer Science courses, including Computer Science 136, as well as fulfilled the Discrete Mathematics Proficiency Requirement by the end of the sophomore year. A Mathematics course at the 200-level or higher (except for MATH 200) must be completed by the end of the junior year. Students are urged to have completed two of the four core courses by the end of the sophomore year and must normally have completed at least three out of the four core courses by the end of the junior year.\n",

      "\n",
      "Computer Science 237 Computer Organization: This course studies the basic instruction set architecture and organization of a modern computer. It provides a programmer's view of how computer systems execute programs, store information, and communicate. Over the semester the student learns the fundamentals of translating higher level languages into assembly language, and the interpretation of machine languages by hardware. At the same time, a model of computer hardware organization is developed from the gate level upward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computer Science 256 Algorithm Design and Analysis: This course investigates methods for designing efficient and reliable algorithms. By carefully analyzing the structure of a problem within a mathematical framework, it is often possible to dramatically decrease the computational resources needed to find a solution. In addition, analysis provides a method for verifying the correctness of an algorithm and accurately estimating its running time and space requirements. We will study several algorithm design strategies that build on data structures and programming techniques introduced in Computer Science 136. These include greedy, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and network flow algorithms. Additional topics of study include algorithms on graphs and strategies for handling potentially intractable problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computer Science 334 Principles of Programming Languages: This course examines the concepts and structures governing the design and implementation of programming languages. It presents an introduction to the concepts behind compilers and run-time representations of programming languages; features of programming languages supporting abstraction and polymorphism; and the procedural, functional, object-oriented, and concurrent programming paradigms. Programs will be required in languages illustrating each of these paradigms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computer Science 361 Theory of Computation: This course introduces a formal framework for investigating both the computability and complexity of problems. We study several models of computation including finite automata, regular languages, context-free grammars, and Turing machines. These models provide a mathematical basis for the study of computability theory--the examination of what problems can be solved and what problems cannot be solved--and the study of complexity theory--the examination of how efficiently problems can be solved. Topics include the halting problem and the P versus NP problem.\n",

And what is the strength of this causal relation? Seeking answers to such causal (as opposed to associational) questions is a fundamental human endeavor; the answers we find can be used to support decision-making in various settings such as healthcare and public policy. But how does one tease apart causation from association--early in our statistical education we are taught that \"correlation does not imply causation.\" In this course, we will re-examine this phrase and learn how to reason with confidence about the validity of causal conclusions drawn from messy real-world data. We will cover core topics in causal inference including causal graphical models, unsupervised learning of the structure of these models, expression of causal quantities as functions of observed data, and robust/efficient estimation of these quantities using statistical and machine learning methods. Concepts in the course will be contextualized via regular case studies.', 'url': 'https://catalog.williams.edu/CSCI/detail/?strm=&cn=379&crsid=021861&req_year=0', 'sections': [{'section': '01', 'classType': 'Lecture', 'sectionType': 'in-person', 'instructors': ['Rohit Bhattacharya'], 'meetings': [{'days': 'MR', 'start': '13:10', 'end': '14:25', 'facility': ''}]}], 'gradingBasisDesc': 'No Pass/Fail and No Fifth Course', 'classFormat': '', 'extraInfo': '', 'crossListing': ['CSCI 379'], 'components': ['Lecture'], 'departmentNotes': '', 'courseAttributes': {'div1': False, 'div2': False, 'div3': True, 'dpe': False, 'qfr': True, 'wac': False, 'passFail': False, 'fifthCourse': False}, 'class_requirements_and_evaluation': 'Problem sets, programming exercises, empirical analyses, case studies, and a final project.', 'prereqs': 'CSCI 136, and either CSCI 256 or STAT 201/202.', 'enrolmentPreferences': 'Computer science majors and prospective majors.'}\u001b[0m\n",
