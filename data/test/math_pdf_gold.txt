MAJOR IN MATHEMATICS: The major in Mathematics is designed to meet two goals: to introduce some of the central ideas in a variety of areas of mathematics and and to develop problem-solving ability by teaching students to combine creative thinking with rigorous reasoning. Mathematics is a gateway to career paths including statistics, teaching, consulting, business, engineering, finance, actuarial studies and applied mathematics. Students are encouraged to consult with the department faculty on choosing courses appropriate to an individualized program of study.
REQUIREMENTS (9 courses plus colloquium): The major in Mathematics consists of nine courses taken at Williams plus the colloquium requirement. Mathematics is highly cumulative, and students should plan a route to completing the major that ensures the proper sequencing and prerequisites for all needed courses. Note that not all upper level courses are offered every year.
Calculus (2 courses): Mathematics 140 Calculus II, Mathematics 150 or 151 Multivariable Calculus 
Applied/Discrete Mathematics/Statistics (1 course): Mathematics 210 Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Physics 210), or Mathematics 200 Discrete Mathematics, or Statistics 201 Statistics and Data Analysis, or Mathematics 309 Differential Equations, or a more advanced applied/discrete/statistics course with prior department approval 
Core Courses (3 courses): Mathematics 250 Linear Algebra, Mathematics 350 Real Analysis or Mathematics 351 Applied Real Analysis, Mathematics 355 Abstract Algebra 
Completion (3 courses plus colloquium): Two mathematics or statistics electives from courses numbered 300 and above 
Completion (3 courses plus colloquium): One Senior Seminar: Any mathematics or statistics course numbered between 400 and 479, taken in the junior or senior year. 
Completion (3 courses plus colloquium): Participation in the Department Colloquium, in which all senior majors present a talk on a mathematical or statistical topic of their choice.  Each major must attend at least 20 colloquia (reduced to 15 during the Academic Year 2020-2021), and up to 5 attendances may be counted in their junior year.   Students engaged in study away may petition the department in advance to count up to 5 suitable colloquia attendances from their study away program. 
Pass/Fail policies during the Academic Year 2020-2021: Information about the Department of Mathematics and Statistics Pass/Fail policies during the Academic Year 2020-2021 can be found here: https://math.williams.edu/mathematics-and-statistics-pass-fail-policies-for-the-academic-year-2020-2021/
ADVANCED PLACEMENT: Students who come to Williams with advanced placement will be moved up in the Mathematics major, and should consult with faculty to be placed in the best class reflecting their experience and background. A student who places out of a course substitutes another course of equal or higher level in Mathematics or Statistics to complete the nine course major. Students should select courses best suited to their preparation and goals, and consult with the department faculty concerning appropriate courses and placement. The department reserves the right to refuse registration in any course for which the student is overqualified.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT: For Example, a student starting in MATH 130 might take MATH 130 and 140 the first year, MATH 150 and MATH 200 the second year, MATH 250 and MATH 350 the third year, MATH 355 and a senior seminar the fourth year, plus the two required electives some time. Students are encouraged to consult freely with any math faculty about course selection and anything else. 
CALCULUS PLACEMENT: Recommended placement for students who have taken an Advanced Placement Examination in Calculus (AB or BC) is: BC 1, 2 or AB 2, 3 Math 140; AB 4 or 5 Math 150; BC 3, 4 or 5 Math 151 
CALCULUS PLACEMENT: Consult with department faculty for any Calculus or Statistics placement questions. Students who have had calculus in high school, whether or not they took the Advanced Placement Examination, are barred from 130 unless they obtain permission from the instructor. 
Substitutions, Study Abroad, and Transfer Credit: In some cases, and with prior permission of the Mathematics and Statistics Department, appropriate courses from other institutions or a course from another Williams department may be substituted for electives. Programs like the “Budapest Semester in Mathematics” are recommended for majors who wish to focus on mathematics away. The department, though, normally accommodates students who select other study away programs. The department offers its core courses in both the fall and the spring to allow students to spend more easily a semester away. 
Double Counting: No course may count towards two different majors. 
Planning Courses: Core courses Mathematics 350/351 and 355, are normally offered every year. Most other 300-level topics are offered in alternate years. Topology, Complex Analysis, and second courses in real analysis and abstract algebra are normally offered at least every other year. Each 400-level topic is normally offered every two to four years. Students should check with the department before planning far into the future. 
Course Admission: Courses are normally open to all students meeting the prerequisites, subject to any course caps. Students with questions about the level at which courses are conducted are invited to consult department faculty. 
Students MUST contact departments/programs BEFORE assuming study away credit will be granted toward the major or concentration. 
Can your department or program typically pre-approve courses for major/concentration credit? Yes, in many cases, though students should be sure to contact the department. 
What criteria will typically be used/required to determine whether a student may receive major/concentration credit for a course taken while on study away? Course title and description, and complete syllabus including readings/assignments. 
Does your department/program place restrictions on the number of major/concentration credits that a student might earn through study away? No. 
Does your department/program place restrictions on the types of courses that can be awarded credit towards your major? Yes. They have to be approved MATH/STAT courses. 
Are there specific major requirements that cannot be fulfilled while on study away? Yes. Colloquium requirement, Senior Seminar requirement. 
Are there specific major requirements in your department/program that students should be particularly aware of when weighing study away options? (Some examples might include a required course that is always taught in one semester, laboratory requirements.) Yes. The highly cumulative structure of the major. 
Give examples in which students thought or assumed that courses taken away would count toward the major or concentration and then learned they wouldn’t: None to date. 
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MATHEMATICS: The degree with honors in Mathematics is awarded to the student who has demonstrated outstanding intellectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of the major. The principal considerations for recommending a student for the degree with honors will be: Mastery of core material and skills, breadth and, particularly, depth of knowledge beyond the core material, ability to pursue independent study of mathematics or statistics, originality in methods of investigation, and, where appropriate, creativity in research. 
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MATHEMATICS: An honors program normally consists of two semesters (MATH/STAT 493 and 494) and a winter study (WSP 031) of independent research, culminating in a thesis and a presentation. Under certain circumstances, the honors work can consist of coordinated study involving a one (MATH/STAT 493 or 494) and a winter study (WSP 030) of independent research, culminating in a “minithesis” and a presentation. Note that during the Academic Year 2020-2021 the winter study requirement for thesis and “minithesis” is waved. At least one semester should be in addition to the major requirements, and thesis courses do not count as 400-level senior seminars. 
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MATHEMATICS: An honors program in actuarial studies requires significant achievement on four appropriate examinations of the Society of Actuaries.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MATHEMATICS: Highest honors will be reserved for the rare student who has displayed exceptional ability, achievement or originality. Such a student usually will have written a thesis, or pursued actuarial honors and written a mini-thesis. An outstanding student who writes a mini-thesis, or pursues actuarial honors and writes a paper, might also be considered. In all cases, the award of honors and highest honors is the decision of the Department.
APPLIED MATHEMATICS TRACK: Students interested in applied mathematics, engineering, or other sciences should consider: Mathematics 140 Calculus II; Mathematics 150 or 151 Multivariable Calculus; Statistics 201 Statistics and Data Analysis; Mathematics 250 Linear Algebra; Mathematics 351 Applied Real Analysis; Mathematics 355 Abstract Algebra; Some programming or numerical analysis (e.g. MATH 361, 318T, or anything if you’ve had CSCI 134); MATH 309 or Post-core Differential Equations/Numerical Methods; Senior seminar (e.g. Math Ecology MATH 410T or Mathematical Modeling MATH 433) 
APPLIED MATHEMATICS TRACK: Other recommended courses: complex analysis, discrete mathematics (e.g. combinatorics or graph theory), operations research, optimization, probability, statistics, appropriate courses in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, Neuroscience, Physics, etc. 
APPLIED MATHEMATICS TRACK: Williams has exchange and joint programs with good engineering schools. Interested students should consult the section on engineering near the beginning of the Bulletin and the Williams pre-engineering advisor for further information. 
GRADUATE SCHOOL TRACK: Students interested in continuing their study of mathematics in graduate school should consider: Mathematics 140 Calculus II; Mathematics 150 or 151 Multivariable Calculus; Mathematics 250 Linear Algebra; Mathematics 350 Real Analysis; Mathematics 355 Abstract Algebra; Complex Analysis; Topology; Some second semester analysis; Some second semester algebra; Some post-core geometry; Thesis; [With prior permission, in unusual circumstances, senior seminar can be waived in favor of harder post-core electives.] 
GRADUATE SCHOOL TRACK: Students headed for graduate school generally take more than this relatively small number of courses required for a liberal arts major. Reading knowledge of a foreign language (French, German, or Russian) can be helpful. 
GRADUATE SCHOOL TRACK: Students interested in studying statistics in graduate school should take STAT 201, 346, 360, a 400 level statistics course and MATH 350/351 and 341 in addition to their other math requirements. 
Other Graduate and Professional Schools: An increasing number of graduate and professional schools require mathematics and statistics as a prerequisite to admission or to attaining their degree. Students interested in graduate or professional training in business, medicine, economics, or psychology are advised to find out the requirements in those fields early in their college careers. 
Statistics and Actuarial Science: Students interested in statistics or actuarial science should consider Mathematics 341, Statistics courses, and Economics 255. Additionally, students should consider taking some number of the actuarial exams given by the Society of Actuaries, which can constitute part of an honors program in actuarial studies (see section on honors above). 
Teaching:  Students interested in teaching mathematics at the elementary or secondary school level should consider courses on teaching, number theory, geometry, statistics, and practice as a tutor or teaching assistant. Winter study courses that provide a teaching practicum are also highly recommended. Consult the Program in Teaching (Professor Susan Engel) and the Office of Career Counseling. 
Business and Finance: Students interested in careers in business or finance should consider Mathematics 333 and Statistics courses. Since these courses address different needs, students should consult with the instructors to determine which seem to be most appropriate for individuals. 
Business and Finance: There are three types of 300-level courses. There are the core courses: Real Analysis, MATH 350/351, and Abstract Algebra Math 355. There are the “precore” courses, which do not have the core courses as prerequisites and have numbers 300-349. Finally, there are those courses that have an Abstract Algebra or Real Analysis prerequisite, which are numbered 360-399.
