    "question": "What does the course numbering system indicate in Computer Science?",
    "answer": "The increase in course numbers from 100 to 400 indicates an increasing level of maturity in the subject expected of students. The middle digit of the course number, particularly in upper-level courses, generally indicates the area of computer science covered by the course.",
    "q_num": 70,
    "ragdoll_answer": "The course numbering system in Computer Science indicates an increasing level of maturity in the subject expected of students, with the increase from 100, through 200 and 300, to 400. Within a series, numeric order does not indicate the relative level of difficulty of courses. Rather, the middle digit of the course number (particularly in upper-level courses) generally indicates the area of computer science covered by the course."
