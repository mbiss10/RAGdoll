    QUESTION: Which course covers Turing Machines?
    =========
    Content: CSCI 361 (Theory Of Computation) descriptionSearch: This course introduces a formal framework for investigating both the computability and complexity of problems. We study several models of computation including finite automata, regular languages, context-free grammars, and Turing machines. These models provide a mathematical basis for the study of computability theory--the examination of what problems can be solved and what problems cannot be solved--and the study of complexity theory--the examination of how efficiently problems can be solved. Topics include the halting problem and the P versus NP problem.

    Content: CSCI 345 (Robotics And Digital Fabrication) descriptionSearch: This course is a hands-on exploration of topics in robotics and digital fabrication. We will experience firsthand how ideas and methods from computer science can be applied to make physical objects, including robots and other machines. The emphasis will be on creative, hands-on experimentation. Along the way, students will learn the basics of embedded systems programming (Arduino), breadboarding, soldering, printed circuit board (PCB) design, mechanical computer-aided design (CAD)--both conventional (OnShape) and programmatic (OpenSCAD)--as well digital fabrication (3D-printing, laser cutting). Students will learn both how to build their own prototypes and how to send out designs to have parts machined professionally. Students will work in teams throughout. The course will culminate in a team robotic design competition testing both functionality and creativity.
